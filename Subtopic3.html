      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> This site offers an alternative to saving money by offering a comparison between purchasing a pre-built PC and purchasing each component of a PC online instead. This site assumes that the purchaser is interested in purchasing a desktop computer, meaning components such as a case or monitor would be additionally required. The site demonstrates that although a pre-built PC is cheaper up-front compared to buying each component, building a PC will result in overall better build quality, in turn leading to a longer lifespan and saving the purchaser money. By buying each component, the purchaser also is informed of each component and their capabilities, while also having the ability to repair a PC themselves. <br>
